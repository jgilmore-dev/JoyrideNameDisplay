# JoyRide Name Display Application

**Making every moment memorable for kids with special needs.**

JoyRide is a car club exclusively for kids with special needs, and this desktop application was built to enhance the VIP experience we provide at every event. During JoyRide events, kids trade the everyday worry of doctor's visits and medication for a chance to cruise in high-end cars and feel like the stars they truly are.

*"People will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel." - Maya Angelou*
