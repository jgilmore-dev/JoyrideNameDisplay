# Control Panel Channel System

The Member Name Display control panel now includes a dual-channel update system that allows you to choose between stable production releases and testing development builds.

## Overview

The control panel channel system provides:

- **Dual-Channel Updates**: Stable and testing channels for the control panel application
- **Easy Channel Switching**: Simple UI to switch between channels
- **Automatic Updates**: Seamless update management based on selected channel
- **Development Workflow**: Test new features without building new executables
- **Production Stability**: Keep production installations on stable releases

## Channel Types

### Stable Channel (Default)
- **Source**: GitHub releases
- **Stability**: High - Production ready
- **Update Frequency**: When releases are published
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Recommended For**: Production environments

### Testing Channel
- **Source**: Development builds and pre-releases
- **Stability**: Variable - May contain bugs
- **Update Frequency**: On every development build or pre-release
- **Risk Level**: Medium to High
- **Recommended For**: Development and testing

## How It Works

### Channel Selection
The control panel stores its update channel preference in a configuration file:
- **Location**: `%APPDATA%/MemberNameDisplay/.update-channel` (Windows)
- **Location**: `~/Library/Application Support/MemberNameDisplay/.update-channel` (macOS)
- **Location**: `~/.config/MemberNameDisplay/.update-channel` (Linux)
- **Default**: `stable` (if file doesn't exist)

### Update Process

#### Stable Channel Updates
1. Check GitHub releases for the latest version
2. Compare with current version
3. Download and install if newer version available
4. Provide release notes and version information

#### Testing Channel Updates
1. Check for pre-releases first
2. If no pre-releases, check latest commit from main branch
3. Create development build information
4. Always consider it an update (for testing purposes)
5. Provide development build details

## User Interface

### Update Manager Section
The control panel includes an enhanced Update Manager section with:

#### Channel Display
- **Current Channel**: Shows the active update channel

## Configuration

### Channel File Format
The channel configuration file contains a single line with the channel name:
```
stable
```
or
```
testing
```

### Automatic Behavior
- **Default Channel**: New installations default to stable
- **Persistent Setting**: Channel preference is saved between sessions
- **Immediate Effect**: Channel changes take effect immediately
- **Automatic Checks**: Update checks respect the selected channel

## Technical Details

### Update Sources

#### Stable Channel Sources
- GitHub releases (primary)
- Local update directory (fallback)
- Network shares (if configured)
- USB drives (if available)

#### Testing Channel Sources
- GitHub pre-releases (primary)
- Latest commit from main branch (fallback)
- Local development builds
- Network development builds

### API Integration

#### GitHub API Endpoints
- **Stable**: `/repos/jgilmore-dev/MemberNameDisplay/releases/latest`
- **Testing**: `/repos/jgilmore-dev/MemberNameDisplay/releases` (for pre-releases)
- **Development**: `/repos/jgilmore-dev/MemberNameDisplay/commits/main`

#### IPC Handlers
- `get-update-channel`: Get current channel information
- `set-update-channel`: Change update channel
- `check-for-updates`: Check for updates on current channel
- `get-update-status`: Get current update status

### Version Comparison
- **Stable**: Standard semantic versioning comparison
- **Testing**: Always considers development builds as updates
- **Fallback**: Graceful fallback to local sources if GitHub unavailable

## Best Practices

### Development Environment
1. **Use Testing Channel**: Switch to testing for development work
2. **Regular Testing**: Test features thoroughly before release
3. **Quick Iteration**: Use testing channel for rapid development cycles
4. **Feature Validation**: Ensure features work correctly before switching back

### Production Environment
1. **Stable Channel Only**: Keep production on stable channel
2. **Test Before Deploy**: Validate updates on testing channel first
3. **Monitor Updates**: Check for updates regularly
4. **Backup Configurations**: Keep backup of working configurations

### Mixed Environment
1. **Clear Labeling**: Clearly mark testing vs production installations
2. **Documentation**: Document which installations use which channel
3. **Regular Audits**: Periodically check channel configurations
4. **Gradual Rollout**: Test new features before full deployment

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Channel Not Changing
1. **Check Permissions**: Ensure write access to user data directory
2. **Restart Application**: Restart the control panel after channel change
3. **File Location**: Verify the channel file is in the correct location
4. **File Format**: Ensure the file contains only "stable" or "testing"

#### Updates Not Available
1. **Check Channel**: Verify you're on the correct channel
2. **Network Connectivity**: Ensure GitHub API access
3. **Version Comparison**: Check if you already have the latest version
4. **API Limits**: GitHub API may have rate limits

#### Testing Channel Issues
1. **No Pre-releases**: Testing channel may not have pre-releases available
2. **Development Builds**: Check if development builds are being created
3. **Commit Access**: Ensure access to main branch commits
4. **Fallback Sources**: Check local and network update sources

### Debugging Commands

#### Check Channel Configuration
```bash
# Windows
