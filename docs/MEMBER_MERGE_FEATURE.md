# Member Merge Feature

## Overview

The Member Merge feature allows you to display multiple members together on a single banner, with their names arranged on separate lines. This is particularly useful for cases where members with different last names need to be displayed as a group, such as:

- Family members with different last names
- Couples who haven't taken the same surname
- Group presentations or awards
- Special event announcements

## How It Works

### Basic Concept
When you merge members, their names are displayed in this format:
```
First Name 1
First Name 2
First Name 3

Last Name 1
Last Name 2
Last Name 3
```

### Features
- **Multi-selection**: Click on multiple members to select them for merging
- **Live Preview**: See exactly how the merged display will look before showing it
- **Queue Support**: Add merged displays to the queue system
- **Status Tracking**: All selected members are marked as displayed when shown
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all banner sizes and orientations

## Using the Merge Feature

### Step 1: Enable Merge Mode
1. In the Member Management section, click the **"ðŸ”— Enable Merge Mode"** button
2. The interface will change to show the merge selection interface

### Step 2: Select Members
1. Click on the members you want to merge together
2. Selected members will be highlighted in green
3. You can select any number of members (recommended: 2-4 for readability)

### Step 3: Preview the Display
1. As you select members, a live preview will show exactly how they'll appear
2. The preview uses the same styling as the actual banner display
3. Review the preview to ensure the names are formatted correctly

### Step 4: Display or Queue
1. **Direct Display**: Click "Display on Banner X" to show immediately
2. **Queue**: Click "Queue for Banner X" to add to the queue system

## Technical Details

### Data Structure
Merged displays use the same data structure as individual members:
```javascript
{
  firstLine: "John\nSarah\nDavid",
  secondLine: "Smith\nJohnson\nWilliams",
  isMerged: true,
  memberIds: [1, 2, 3]
}
```

### Display Formatting
- **Line Breaks**: Uses `\n` for line separation
- **CSS**: `white-space: pre-line` preserves line breaks
- **Font Sizing**: Automatically adjusts to fit content
- **Alignment**: Center-aligned for optimal visibility

### Queue Integration
- Merged displays work seamlessly with the queue system
- Can be moved between banners using queue management
- Maintains merge information in queue entries

## Best Practices

### Selection Guidelines
- **Optimal Count**: 2-4 members for best readability
- **Name Length**: Consider total character count for font sizing
- **Grouping**: Select related members (families, couples, etc.)

### Display Considerations
- **Font Size**: Longer names may result in smaller font sizes
- **Screen Space**: Ensure adequate vertical space for multiple lines
- **Readability**: Test with actual banner displays when possible

### Workflow Tips
1. **Plan Ahead**: Decide which members to merge before starting
2. **Use Preview**: Always review the preview before displaying
3. **Queue Management**: Use queues for complex multi-banner setups
4. **Clear Selection**: Start fresh for each new merge group

## Use Cases

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Font Too Small**

- Consider splitting into multiple displays

**Names Not Aligning**
- Ensure all members have complete name data
- Check for missing first or last names
- Verify CSV data format

**Preview Not Updating**
- Click on members again to refresh selection
- Check browser console for errors
- Refresh the page if needed

**Queue Issues**
- Verify banner is enabled and connected
- Check queue management interface
- Ensure proper permissions

### Performance Notes

- Large member lists are handled with virtualization
- Preview updates are optimized for smooth interaction
