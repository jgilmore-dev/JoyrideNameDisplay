## Design Guidelines
- Use your organization or event brand colors and logo
- Ensure good contrast for visibility at small sizes
- Test how it looks in grayscale (for accessibility)
- Keep the design simple and recognizable
- Consider how it will look on both light and dark backgrounds

## File Placement
Place the final icon files in this directory (`src/assets/icons/`) to replace the placeholder files.

## Main Logo
- The main logo file is `MemberNameDisplayLogo.png` in this directory. Use this for all branding and to generate icons as needed.
